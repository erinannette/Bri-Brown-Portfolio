                <h3>The Concessions</h3>
                <h4>(3 w, 2 m)</h4>
                <p>
                    The Concessions centres around an inexplicable act of violence in a rural community. When Fay, a local tarot reader, fails to either foresee or prevent this tragedy, she questions the belief on which she has based her life. Faith, trust, and moving on after community crisis are some of the themes weaving through this hauntingly beautiful piece of Canadian gothic.
                </p>

                    An almost-couple makes a simple pact: they won’t start their relationship until they get that first moment

                    Grounded for the week leading up to her tenth birthday, Cassandra embarks on a journey to get an A+ in life, and finds herself choosing whether it’s better to eat whole or multigrain toast, to be a corporate accountant or folk-rock genius, and whether she’d rather live in a world of reality, or in the realm of dreams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Originally performed by the playwright at fringe festivals in London, Ottawa, Victoria and Vancouver. Remounted at Sarasvati Productions’ FemFest in October 2007.
