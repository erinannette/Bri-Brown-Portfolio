                    <h3>The Concessions</h3>
                    <h4>(3 w, 2 m)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Concessions centres around an inexplicable act of violence in a rural community. When Fay, a local tarot reader, fails to either foresee or prevent this tragedy, she questions the belief on which she has based her life. Faith, trust, and moving on after community crisis are some of the themes weaving through this hauntingly beautiful piece of Canadian gothic.

                        An almost-couple makes a simple pact: they won’t start their relationship until they get that first moment
                        absolutely right. When the goal is perfection, it’s easy to get it wrong.

                    <p>
                        Grounded for the week leading up to her tenth birthday, Cassandra embarks on a journey to get an A+ in life, and finds herself choosing whether it’s better to eat whole or multigrain toast, to be a corporate accountant or folk-rock genius, and whether she’d rather live in a world of reality, or in the realm of dreams.

            <h4>Christmastown</h4>
            <p>
                A new comedy exploring the fragility and strength of community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kringle, ON. It’s July, and it’s hot. It’s also the second week of 52 straight weeks of Christmas. An inspired attempt to woo tourists to the once-thriving, now-struggling village, constant Christmas turns out to be more complicated than the residents of Kringle originally thought. While struggling with their own logistics and complications an entrepreneur from Toronto arrives with a proposal which will force Kringle’s residents to commit
                to Christmas indefinitely, or completely reconsider.
            </p>

            <h4>Wendy, Darling</h4>
            <p>
                Wendy, Darling is a contemporary, full-length musical comedy based on JM Barrie’s Peter Pan. Telling the story from
                Wendy’s perspective, we discover what happens to Neverland and its beautiful cast of characters between the end of Peter Pan and J.M. Barrie’s epilogue When Wendy Grew up, and how Wendy came to have her baby, Janey.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pixie dust of Neverland has started to wear off, and edging on 40, Wendy and Peter have hit a bit of an existential midlife crisis. Namely, Wendy wants to have a baby and settle down, and Peter, well, Peter is not ready to ‘grow up’. What is the point in growing up anyway? Isn’t their love enough? What’s better than a life of sex, pixie dust and rock n’ roll? But Hook lingers with his clocks, reminding Wendy that time does tick on and some clocks stop for good. The other colourful cast of characters – Tink, Tiger Lily and Hook – all play their roles in highlighting Wendy’s wild array of 21st century options. What’s a woman with choice to choose?
            </p>
            <p>
                More than a stereotypical battle of the sexes, Wendy, Darling takes a story from our cultural collective unconscious and brings into a more progressive and present light. While preserving the magic and depth of Barrie’s original themes and characters, we hope to use this source as a launch pad into a world of high-energy dance, contemporary and eclectic music, and thought-provoking and entertaining musical theatre.
