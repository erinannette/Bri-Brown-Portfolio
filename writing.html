                    <h3>The Concessions</h3>
                    <h4>(3 w, 2 m)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Concessions centres around an inexplicable act of violence in a rural community. When Fay, a local tarot reader, fails to either foresee or prevent this tragedy, she questions the belief on which she has based her life. Faith, trust, and moving on after community crisis are some of the themes weaving through this hauntingly beautiful piece of Canadian gothic.
